During the development internet stranges have started to show some interest in the project and have made various pull requests. Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/shelltitan">shelltitan</a> who alsmost single-handedly has made all new gameplay features.</p>

<h2><a id="Future_22"></a>Future</h2>
<p>The v0.4.0 beta-test will be conducted and the results will determine the path of the further development. If network will work correctly then it will be considered to make the v0.5.0 milestone more gameplay oriented. However, it is important to continue improving the game engine because in long term it is more efficient. So the v0.5.0 milestone planning is a separate hard task, and it will be done later.</p>
